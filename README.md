# TERMINAL TEXT EDITOR

**Learning C++ one line at a time.**

This is a simple terminal-based text editor project, written in C++. It started as a way to learn the fundamentals of C++ — from structs to vectors — and will gradually evolve into a functional text editor.

## Day 1 progress 

This is a simple terminal-based text editor project,written in C++. It started as a way to learn the fundamentals of C++ — from structs to vectors — and will gradually evolve into a functional text editor.

- [x] Project initialized with Git & GitHub
- [x] Created Task struct in task.hpp
- [x] Used vector to store tasks
- [x] Added and accessed tasks in main.cpp
- [x] Printed task descriptions to the terminal

 [x] means the task is completed.
  


## Next Steps

- [ ] Take task input from the user
- [ ] Store multiple tasks dynamically
- [ ] Display all tasks in a loop

[ ] means the task is still pending.


## Build and Run

To compile and run the program, use these commands in the terminal:

g++ main.cpp -o texteditor

./texteditor
